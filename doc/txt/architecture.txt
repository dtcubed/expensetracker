Client
------
Will merely build up a properly formed file consisting of one (1) or
more expense records. Then, after some unique information has been
prepended onto the front of the file, SSH will be utilized to SCP
the file to the proper place on the expense server.

Expense Server
---------------
There will be some daemon code running on the Expense Server.
This code will pick up the expense record file(s) and INSERT them
into the RDBM.

Actually, it is envisioned that this daemon code be responsible
for processing all files which lead to Create, Update, and Delete
operation against the RDBMS.

Web Application 
----------------
Eventually, there will be a web application (HTTPS) from which the
user can:
-- Conduct Read operations against the RDBMS.
-- Correct expense category information.
-- Upload files of expense records.
-- Split expenses, update expense comments and categorization.
-- Run reports, etc.

Some Architectual Pieces
------------------------
-- RDBMS (will probably start out with SQLite, but consider going to something like Postgres later)
-- SSH Client
-- SSH Server
-- Web Server (HTTPS)
